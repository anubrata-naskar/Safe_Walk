        At Safe Walk, our mission is simple: to help women feel safer and more confident while moving through public spaces.
        We believe safety is a right, not a privilege — and we’re building technology that supports that vision.
        Our platform empowers users by showing real-time safety parameters for their current location — including lighting,
        foot traffic, crime reports, and recent user reviews. With just a glance, you can see how safe your surroundings are
        and make informed decisions about your route.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even more importantly, Safe Walk highlights nearby help zones, such as police stations, hospitals, open businesses,
        safe spaces, and community hubs — so you always know where to turn if you need assistance.
        Whether you’re walking home late, navigating a new area, or just checking in before heading out, Safe Walk is your
        personal safety companion. Together, we’re creating a world where women walk free, walk strong — and walk safe.
